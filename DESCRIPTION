Description: Tools to perform energy balancing, a method of estimating weights 
             analogous to inverse probability weights for use in matching a distribution
             to a target distribution. The weights can be usef in a broad
             class of methods, including reducing confounding in observational
             studies, generalizing findings from a sample to a population, 
             adjusting for censoring, and more. See Huling and Mak (2020) 
             <http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13962> for details on the method.
